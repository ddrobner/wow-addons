This release is (mostly) a work-around Twitch bug (case number) 02836759 from September 1st 2019 which they decided to close as "Resolved" without actually fixing so far.
My Twitch Desktop App is still affected by this bug.

The bug is that the Twitch App cannot properly detect addon versions for addons that support both Classic WoW and Retail WoW in the same addon package.
When the bug happens, the Twitch Desktop App will show as "latest" the most recent addon version that was released WITHOUT dual-WoW version support.
